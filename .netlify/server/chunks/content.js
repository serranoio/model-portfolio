    We need to accept that problems are a part of life, we need to accept that we will make mistakes, because it is what makes life so beautiful. 
    From the day that you were born, you have been exploring this world, making mistakes and having problems. They are a part of life.
    And when the light becomes dim and the times become obscure, don't ever forget that this darkness is what makes life so beautiful and the good times so sweet.
    So treat the problems as opportunities for growth, mistakes as lessons to be learned from, because the pressure can transform you into a diamond.  You can channel the negative energy into raw, immense power for you to grow into who youre meant to be. 
    You are the artist of your life who paints it to whatever you want and every stroke that you paint is intentful towards creating a beautiful, elegant, extraordinary life.
